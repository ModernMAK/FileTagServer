Im stumbling trying to find a 'GOOD' solution that im not making much headway.
So instead, lets write about my problems, and work through them.

So, this application needs to address the following problems.
~ Map FILES to TAGS
	At it's core this is what the entire project is supposed to do, if i strip away all the bells and whistles, at the end of the day, this is what I want to do

~ Display FILES as WebPages w/ Tags
	Different webpages require different rules for displaying things

~ Client-Only Mode / Client-Serve Mode / Server-Only Mode
	~ Clients watch folders and 'uploads' them to the DB, files are tracked by a .meta file 
	~ Servers request uploads and aren't required to track files (presumably, these files should be considered static)
