~ Move startup logic to a dedicated startup script?
	A lot of watchdog code should probably be moved out of main and into a module.
	Also should strip Watchman of excess code

~ Fix Sidebar
	Sidebar currently vanishes when the screen gets too small. Preferrably, should be placed underneath content

~ Pagination
	While we support paging, its hard-coded right now. Also no way of advancing pages

~ Generated Content
	Content Generation should also be moved to its own module, since its kinda all over the place

~ Previews
	We cache extension, but we should probably cache a MIME-Like attribute which describes the type of content and how we should handle it: ~ File/Music ~ File/Image ~ File/PDF ~ alternatively we can just generate the mime-like from the extension every time we fetch

~ Naming / Describing Files
	Making it look good is the hard part

~ Deleting / Hiding Files
	Adding Meta information to not track the file (hidden) or just completely deleting the file

~ Tag Classes
	Grouping tags by what they represent ~ Charachters / Franchise
