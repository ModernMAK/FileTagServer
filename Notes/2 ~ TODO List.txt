~ Move startup logic to a dedicated startup script?
	A lot of watchdog code should probably be moved out of main and into a module.
	Also should strip Watchman of excess code

~ Fix Sidebar
	Sidebar currently vanishes when the screen gets too small. Preferrably, should be placed underneath content
	UPDATE: Collapses (to top, cant collapse to bottom without appearing on right side)

~ Pagination
	While we support paging, its hard-coded right now. Also no way of advancing pages
	UPDATE: Now supported on Images (should be renamed to files)
	UPDATE: Looks prettier

~ Generated Content
	Content Generation should also be moved to its own module, since its kinda all over the place
	UPDATE: Content Gen now supported

~ Previews
	We cache extension, but we should probably cache a MIME-Like attribute which describes the type of content and how we should handle it: ~ File/Music ~ File/Image ~ File/PDF ~ alternatively we can just generate the mime-like from the extension every time we fetch

~ Naming / Describing Files
	Making it look good is the hard part

~ Deleting / Hiding Files
	Adding Meta information to not track the file (hidden) or just completely deleting the file

~ Tag Classes
	Grouping tags by what they represent ~ Charachters / Franchise 

~ META BUG
	We seem to recreate meta files over and over again (.meta.meta.meta.*) so fix that
	UPDATE: Seems to have been fixed previously, and metas were not cleaned up

~ Rename show/image to show/file
	Simple as that, for consistancy
	UPDATE: Done
